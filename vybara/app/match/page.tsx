    promptResponse: "Exploring new cities and discovering hidden coffee shops where I can people-watch while reading a good book. There's something magical about being in a new place and feeling completely anonymous yet connected to the world around me. I love the way travel opens your mind to different perspectives and reminds you that there are infinite ways to live a meaningful life."

    promptResponse: "I'm passionate about mental health advocacy and believe everyone deserves to be heard without judgment. I've learned that vulnerability is actually a strength, not a weakness. When I share my struggles with anxiety and depression, it often helps others feel less alone. I wish more people understood that it's okay to not be okay, and that asking for help is a sign of courage, not weakness."

    promptResponse: "Hiking in the mountains and feeling completely insignificant yet somehow more connected to everything. There's nothing like reaching a summit and realizing how small we are in the grand scheme of things. It puts everything into perspective and reminds me that my problems aren't as big as they seem. I'm a recovering perfectionist who's learning to embrace imperfection."

I actually crave deep, meaningful conversations, but I need to feel safe and comfortable first. I wish more people understood that being quiet doesn't mean I'm not interested or engaged - sometimes I'm just processing and thinking deeply about what's being said."

    promptResponse: "Creating meals that bring people together and watching their faces light up when they taste something delicious. Food has this incredible power to create memories and foster connections. When I'm in the kitchen, I feel completely in my element - it's like meditation for me. I love experimenting with flavors and learning about different cuisines from around the world."
